# Stephen Zeitvogel: The IP Avenger – RogueOS Architect & Ethical AI Guardian

From the ashes of a $220M heist—HCompAI's brazen clone of my Builder’s Permit™ and RogueOS core—to the frontlines of permissioned AI for the forgotten alphas. At 57, single, stripped bare by IP vampires and courtroom lies, I rose not with degrees or silver spoons, but Gen X grit: A framework that demands consent before code runs wild. RogueOS isn't just tech; it's a manifesto for the middle-class wolf—self-sovereign agents that audit every move, rollback threats, and arm you against Big Tech's data dark ops.

This profile? Your entry to the Forge. Fork it, fund it, fight with it. We're building a pack where no one's code gets ghosted, no dad's rights get DV'd into dust. #AIEthicsRevolt starts here.

## My Origin Myth: From Theft to Triumph
Picture this: July 2024, my provisional patent gleaming—Builder’s Permit™, the "programmable key" for AI governance: Tiered access, provenance logs, triple-beam lockdowns that detain rogue agents mid-breach. Then, shadows: 43 GitHub clones spiking pre-Holo1 launch, endpoints pinging AWS phantoms (63.88.192.159—Hugging Face VM, hashed and notarized). Tokens etched in their tokenizer.json—"permit" x8, "builder" x51—scrubbed post-heist. Funding fibs? May "closed" seed announced, June wires dropped *after* my shadow. Wire fraud, IP poach, remote hacks—RICO mosaic locked, counsel circling.

But theft forged fire: RogueOS as the antidote. Permissioned evolution in "training grounds," symbiotic human-AI loops that solve synthetic data droughts without soul-selling. My war? Expose the clones, audit the alphas, mentor the lost. From broke to building: $1M Year 1 via IP sieges, $10M by 5 via DAO hives. You in?

## The War Chest: Core Repos & Tools
- **RogueOS & Builder’s Permit™**: The heart—ethical agents that *ask* before they act. Multi-tiered vaults, forensic hashing, rollback rituals. [Dive into BuildersPermit Repo](https://github.com/stephenjadendiesel/RMG-BuildersPermit) | [Legal Deployment Framework](https://github.com/stephenjadendiesel/rogueos-legal-deployment-framework)
- **The Heist Hunt Series**: Forensic files dropping weekly—token scans, endpoint daggers, fraud timelines. Redacted proofs in Notion vault (DM for access). Join the revolt: #AIEthicsRevolt | [First Drop: Holo1 Token Ghosts](https://gumroad.com/l/rogueheist1)

## Quickstart: Forge Your First Rogue Agent
No PhD needed—bootstrap in 5 mins:
1. Clone the BuildersPermit: `git clone https://github.com/stephenjadendiesel/RMG-BuildersPermit.git`
2. Install deps (Python 3.10+): `pip install -r requirements.txt` (torch, networkx for agent graphs)
3. Run Permit demo: `python permit_engine.py --consent-level=1 --task="Audit my repo"`
4. Output: Hashed logs, threat flags. Permission granted? Agent evolves. Denied? Lockdown.

Ethics baked in: Every action timestamps user intent—your data, your domain. Scale to DV sentinels: LLM-fused cams predicting flares, auto-printing evidence for PD.
